# Enumerable Methods

> For this project, I have produced my own versions of a number of common methods in Ruby's Enumerable module:

* #class_check - a method which checks for the available classes and apply my_select to them for later usage.
* #my_each - a method which behaves like #each. 
* #my_select - a method which behaves like #select.
* #my_all? - a method which behaves like #all?.
* #my_any? - a method which behaves like #any?.
* #my_none? - a method which behaves like #none?.
* #my_count - a method which behaves like #count.
* #my_map - a method which behaves like #map. This method was also modified to accept either a proc or a block.
* #my_inject - which behaves like #inject.
* #multiply_els - which uses #my_inject to multiply elements accumulatively.

Every method has been tested on hashes, arrays and ranges to mirror the behaviour of the methods they were modelled from.

And We have created a spec folder that is responsible for the tests and for all methods mentioned above tested with arrays and one proc variable.

## Built With

* Ruby
* Rubocop
* Rspec

## Prerequisities

To get this project up and running, you must already have ruby installed on your computer.

## Automated Tests

There are 20 tests have been added to the repo. Those are all checking the implementation of the "new enumerable methods" with arrays and one proc.
To run tests, clone repository, install 'rspec' and then run ```rspec``` in the local folder.
