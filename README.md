# Enumerable Methods

> For this project, I have produced my own versions of a number of common methods in Ruby's Enumerable module:

* #class_check - a method which checks for the available classes and apply my_select to them for later usage.
* #my_each - a method which behaves like #each. 
* #my_select - a method which behaves like #select.
* #my_all? - a method which behaves like #all?.
* #my_any? - a method which behaves like #any?.
* #my_none? - a method which behaves like #none?.
* #my_count - a method which behaves like #count.
* #my_map - a method which behaves like #map. This method was also modified to accept either a proc or a block.
* #my_inject - which behaves like #inject.
* #multiply_els - which uses #my_inject to multiply elements accumulatively.

Every method has been tested on hashes, arrays and ranges to mirror the behaviour of the methods they were modelled from.

## Built With

* Ruby
